# 2109120504 perhaps community finance could be used to electrify sightseeing buses

#climate #air-quality #carbon #idea #co-operatives

Sightseeing buses drive round cities, showing passengers the different sights.
They are highly polluting as they are powered by diesel and they spend a lot of
time idling at stops.

I wonder what the main barriers are to electrifying these buses.

If it's money, perhaps a community energy co-operative could provide the
finance?

We could raise money from the community with an expected return of say 3-5%. We
would pay for the electrification of the bus. The bus owner would pay back the
loan at a slightly higher rate, but lower than a bank loan. The difference could
provide a community benefit fund that subsidises other decarbonising projects.

The newly electrified buses would be cheaper to run on electricity than diesel
so overall there would be a positive ROI for the owner. Maybe.

## Known unknowns

* Is money the main barrier to electrifying buses?
* How much does it cost to electrify a bus?
* Where would it charge and what would the range be?
* Would there be a positive ROI for the owner?
* Are bus owners be interested in electrifying their buses?
* How would you ensure the owner pays back the loan to the community?
* Who else has attempted this?
